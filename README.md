## 🛠 Utility Scripts
The repository also contains useful shell scripts for automation:

- `ecut_bash.sh` – convergence test for energy cutoff  
- `bash_kpoints.sh` – convergence test for k-point mesh  
- `Smearing_bash.sh` – smearing convergence test  

These scripts are helpful for systematic convergence studies.
